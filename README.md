## Coding Challenges Collection

Here I include my solutions to free coding challenges found in the internet. The goal is to collect a number of exercises for personal reference and to practice my skills solving common algorithm problems.

Each exercise will include the description of the problem and brief explanation of the approach to solve it. I also include a _solution.js_ file with the code.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or observations.
