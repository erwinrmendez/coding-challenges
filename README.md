## Coding Challenges Collection

Here I include my solutions to free coding challenges found in the internet. The goal is to collect a number of exercises for personal reference and to practice my skills solving common algorithm problems.

Each exercise will include the description of the problem and brief explanation of the approach to solve it. I also include a _solution.js_ file with the code.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or observations.

| [Merge Sorted](MergeSorted.js)                      | You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively. Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order. The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.                                                                                                                | [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)                                                        |

| [Rotational Cipher](RotationalCipher.js)            | One simple way to encrypt a string is to "rotate" every alphanumeric character by a certain amount. Rotating a character means replacing it with another character that is a certain number of steps away in normal alphabetic or numerical order. For example, if the string "Zebra-493? is rotated 3 places, the resulting string is "Cheud-726?". Every alphabetic character is replaced with the character 3 letters higher (wrapping around from Z to A), and every numeric character replaced with the character 3 digits higher (wrapping around from 9 to 0). Note that the non-alphanumeric characters remain unchanged. Given a string and a rotation factor, return an encrypted string. | [Facebook Recruiting](https://www.facebookrecruiting.com/portal/interview_prep_hub?scrollToSection=CODING_EXERCISES) |

| [Valid Palindrome](ValidPalindrome.js)              | A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward.
